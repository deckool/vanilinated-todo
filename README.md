## Vanilla Javascript todo list using localStorage for persistance

A simple implementation of a todo list using plain Javascript with local storage.
Tested in `Chromium 27`, `Firefox 21` and `Opera 12`. It has a lot of chances to work on all browser that support local storage.

If you test it in other browsers please send me a pull request for this `README` page.

You can view a demo [here].

For participation use the issues.
